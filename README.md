# 📚 Complete DSA Course 🚀

Welcome to the **Complete DSA Course** repository! This repository is a comprehensive guide to mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** from scratch. Whether you are a beginner looking to build a strong foundation or an experienced programmer aiming to strengthen your problem-solving skills, this repo is for you.

## 🌟 What are Data Structures and Algorithms?

### 📌 Data Structures

A **Data Structure** is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. It defines the layout and format of data in memory.

#### ✅ Types of Data Structures:

1. **Linear Data Structures:**
   * Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues.
2. **Non-Linear Data Structures:**
    Trees, Graphs.
3. **Hash-Based Data Structures:**
   * Hash Tables, Hash Maps.

### 📌 Algorithms
An **Algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure to perform a specific task or solve a problem. The efficiency of an algorithm is measured based on time complexity and space complexity.

#### ✅ Types of Algorithms:

1. **Search Algorithms:** Linear Search, Binary Search.
2. **Sorting Algorithms:** Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort.
3. **Graph Algorithms:** BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm.
4. **Dynamic Programming:** Fibonacci Series, Knapsack Problem.
5. **Greedy Algorithms:** Prim’s Algorithm, Kruskal’s Algorithm.
6. **Backtracking Algorithms:** N-Queens, Sudoku Solver.
