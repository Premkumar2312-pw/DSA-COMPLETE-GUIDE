ðŸ“Œ What are Arrays?


An Array is a data structure used to store multiple elements of the same type in a single variable. It organizes data in a contiguous block of memory, where each element can be accessed using its index or position in the array. Arrays provide efficient indexing, making them one of the most fundamental data structures in programming.

Key Characteristics of Arrays:

Homogeneous: All elements in an array are of the same type.

Indexed: Each element can be accessed using an index (starting from 0).

Fixed Size: The size of the array is typically fixed when it is created.

ðŸ“Œ Types of Arrays:

1.One-Dimensional Array:
A simple linear array that stores elements in a single line.

2.Two-Dimensional Array:
An array of arrays, often used to represent matrices or grids.

3.Multi-Dimensional Array:
Arrays with more than two dimensions, used in complex data representation like 3D arrays.

ðŸ“Œ Array Operations:

Arrays support several basic operations that allow you to manipulate or query the data stored within them. Common array operations include:

1.Traversal: Visiting each element in the array.

2.Insertion: Adding an element to the array.

3.Deletion: Removing an element from the array.

4.Searching: Finding the presence of an element.

5.Updating: Modifying an element of the array.
